# Scoreboard App

This is a simple scoreboard app built as a personal project to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add 1, 2, or 3 points to two teams — Home and Guest — with real-time score updates.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:
- See the score for two teams: Home and Guest
- Click +1, +2, or +3 buttons to increase each team’s score
- Use a responsive and clean UI that mimics a classic scoreboard
- View custom font styling that matches the design

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic **HTML5**
- **CSS3** with custom font and responsive layout
- **Vanilla JavaScript** for DOM manipulation

### What I learned

- How to create a simple UI layout using Flexbox
- How to use `textContent` to update HTML from JavaScript
- How to attach event listeners with `addEventListener()` instead of inline `onclick`
- How to structure a small project with clear HTML, CSS, and JS separation

### Continued development

In the future, I’d like to:
- Add a “Reset” button  
- Highlight which team is leading  
- Animate score changes for a smoother UX  
- Store scores in `localStorage` so they persist after refresh
